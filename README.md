# spotify_top_50
# This is code from a Data Analytics bootcamp project that pulls track information from the top 50 songs by country from Spotify's API, does some automated analysis, and produces several matplotlib figures. Scripted data collection, analysis, figure generation, and general project design were done by me and can be found in this repo.
